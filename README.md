# Comps-Hi chat app

**This project is a Peer to Peer network application that will allow peers to stablish connections with other peers to send messages between each other, peers will be able to register and exit the network whenever they please. In order to achieve our objectives we will be using an unstrucutured centralized model. This model relies on a index server to facilitate the discovery of peers within the network. If any peers join, they register within the index server, and when they want to communicate with other peers they first need to inquire the index server for suitable connections.**

## Objectives

* This P2P network application will allow peers to enter and exit the network.
* Allow peers to register, search, send and recieve messages.
* Turn a peer from a client to a provider.
* Send and recieve error messages.
* Work with peers within a local network.

## Getting Started


### To run this app 

1. To start the server run the command 'python3 Server.py' this would start the server, making peers be found, registering peers, and allowing them to exit.
2. To start the client run the command 'python3 client.py' this would allow for peers to connect to the server, retrieve peer details, send and recieve messages.

### Usage

**After running both the client and server, these are the following actions a peer might take.**

* `Clicking 1 allows the peer to see a list of all the peers available`
* `Clicking 2 allows the peer to get information about other peers`
* Clicking 3 allows the peer to send a message to another peer'
* Clicking 4 allows the peer to exit the network
