# Comps-Hi chat app

**This project is a Peer to Peer network application that will allow peers to stablish connections with other peers to send messages between each other, peers will be able to register and exit the network whenever they please. In order to achieve our objectives we will be using an unstrucutured centralized model. This model relies on a index server to facilitate the discovery of peers within the network. If any peers join, they register within the index server, and when they want to communicate with other peers they first need to inquire the index server for suitable connections.**

## Objectives

* This P2P network application will allow peers to enter and exit the network.
* Allow peers to register, search, send and recieve messages.
